# create a list of products
products = ["Washing machine", "Coffee maker", "Freezer", "Fridge"]

# this is the raw format of the collection if printed
# ONLY USE for testing/debugging purposes, to quickly see what's inside
# this format is not user-friendly, so don't use as the actual output
# also, it always shows everything in the collection
# (including potentially sensitive information, if there's any)
# print(products)

# get a single element from the list
# first index is 0, second is 1 etc.
# kinda like -1 of what you're seeking
# otherwise acts like a bunch of variables!
