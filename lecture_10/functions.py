# functions.py, this file contains
# the definitions of all our functions
# kinda like a toolkit, ready to be used
# by our other applications

# NOTE: a function does NOTHING in code
# unless it's used/called somewhere

# define a function show_text()
# this means: "what should my code do, if something HAPPENED to
# call this function somewhere"
def show_text():
    print("Welcome to our application!")
    print("---------------------------")
    print("Please follow the instructions.")
