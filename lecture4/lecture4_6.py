# TASK 3: Create an application that asks the user the name of the product
# and the amount of products they wish to buy.
# for example: they want to buy 10 smartphones etc.

# Also ask if the user has a discount voucher (yes/no)

# the pricing is the following:
# - smartphone = 599 € per item
# - computer = 899 € per item
# - coffee machine = 129 € per item

# calculate the total price of the user's products

# if the user has a discount voucher, reduce 15% from the total price

# Finally, print the price rounded to two decimals and inform
# the user IF a voucher was used to reduce the price.
# If no voucher used, don't mention it.

# things to think about:
# do we need nesting?
# do we need if-elif or separate if -structures
# ...or do we need both?
