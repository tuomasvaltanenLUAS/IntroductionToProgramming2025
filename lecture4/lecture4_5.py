# TASK 2: Create a simple calculator, where user can perform
# one of the following operations: +, -, * and /

# in the beginning, ask the user for two numbers in float-format,
# ask finally which operation they would like to perform BETWEEN the numbers
# after the inputs, perform the selected operation between the numbers,
# if the selections were correct

# if user selects division (/), check that the second number is not 0.
# if user still gives a 0 as a second number, INFORM THE USER
# that we can't divide by zero

# if the user selects an operation that is not supported
# inform the user "Incorrect operation."

# print the result rounded to one decimal
